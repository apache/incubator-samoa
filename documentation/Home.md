Apache SAMOA is a distributed realtime machine learning system, similar to Mahout, but specific designed for stream mining. Apache SAMOA is simple and fun to use!

This documentation is intended to give an introduction on how to use Apache SAMOA in different ways. As a user you can run Apache SAMOA algorithms into several Stream Processing Engines: local mode, Apache Storm, S4 and Samza. As a developer you can create new algorithms only once and test them in all of these Stream Processing Engines.
