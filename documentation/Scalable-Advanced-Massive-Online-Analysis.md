Scalable Advanced Massive Online Analysis (SAMOA) contains various algorithms for machine learning and data mining on data streams, and allows to run them on different distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs) such as Storm and S4. Currently, SAMOA contains methods for classification via Vertical Hoeffding Trees, bagging and boosting and clustering via CluStream.

In this pages, we explain how to build and execute SAMOA for the different distributed stream processing engines (DSPEs): 

* [Building SAMOA](Building-SAMOA.html)
* [Executing SAMOA with Apache Storm](Executing-SAMOA-with-Apache-Storm.html)
* [Executing SAMOA with Apache S4](Executing-SAMOA-with-Apache-S4.html)
* [Executing SAMOA with Apache Samza](Executing-SAMOA-with-Apache-Samza.html)
